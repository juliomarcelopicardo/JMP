- There are two versions and ways to use it.

1st. SINGLE HEADER.

Ideal for using with simple applications that have only one file, so just by including the jmp.h file, that can be found in the single_header folder, is enough to start using it.

2nd. COMPLETE VERSION.

This is the most complete version, the one recommended to use as part of another existing software.
To use it it's as simple as copying the folders "include" and "src", and then compile them inside as part of the application project.

To start using it in a C++ application it is just needed to include the file "jmp.h" that can be found in the include folder.
